\f0\fs24 \cf0 One of the things talked about in last weeks videos was that the background of a site shouldn't take away from it's purpose. In the case of Vimeo's site, the background is overly complex, and I think definitely takes away from the feel and usage of the site. Also, the images used for vimeo's background are very random and don't have much to do with what vimeo is or what they're trying to promote.\

I also think the change of backgrounds as you scroll down is not how it should be. It goes from the crazy psychedelic background at the top to a dark grey, then a light grey, then back to the one on top. I think the flow could be much better if there was a more consistent layout style that they stuck to. However, being that vimeo is a site to upload, view, and share videos, I think they have a much better site than their competitor youtube.\

The color scheme could use some work, as stated above. The text could be a bit more exciting than just a boring sans serif, however, that was probably the look they were going for.}
