Critique of jasonsantamaria.com	The first thing that comes into my head when I first visit the URL is “What is the purpose of this website?” For someone that doesn’t already know who Jason Santa Maria is and what he does for a living, the website is very confusing. Even when you visit the “About” tab on the site, there is a sentence that says, “This experiment isn't meant to shatter new depths of graphic design, but to find the voice in the visuals so that they can become an equal partner in the story being told.” To me, it just seems like a very roundabout way of describing what the site is and how to navigate through it. Which brings me to my next point on navigation.	The navigation through the site is somewhat unorganized and not complete. For instance, the portfolio tab has nothing there. Furthermore, the articles tab has a conglomeration words to filter your search, but some of the filter words don’t provide any results (League Gothic, New York, Basic Gothic).	Another downfall of the site is the color scheme. Jason used a simple white, red, and grey color scheme, which gets very boring after a while. When I navigate through the different tabs, I almost expect a change in the look of the page, not something that would be inconsistent and out of line with the rest of the site, but maybe a little more flair. To be fair, there are also many good things about this site, but since this is a critique, I won’t mention them.Joshua FoleyTC-349jsm.txt
