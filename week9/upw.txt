\f0\fs24 \cf0 First off, to figure out exactly what United Pixel Workers was I had to scroll to the bottom of the FAQ tab. I thought at first it was just a T-Shirt company that designed pixellated shirt logos and such. I think they need to show that the whole idea of pixel workers is an unspoken union of web designers, developers, and user experience architects. The t-shirt idea is cool, but it shouldn't be the main focus of a group of designers. Also, after scrolling to the bottom of the FAQ page, I noticed there's a ton of unused space at the bottom, which goes for the other tabs as well.\

The pixelivery tab is somewhat confusing too because it redirects you to a new page and theres no navigation button to get you back to United Pixel Workers. The scroll bar on the white space of the screen on all the tabs is also almost invisible. They need to contrast the color on that a bit more so you can see how far down the page you are scrolling.}
