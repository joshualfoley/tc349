<p>Here is the layout that I did for the Foldable Me site. It's similar to the layout they currently have, because I think that layout works well.</p>

<p>Here is the layout that my roommate did for the Foldable Me site. It's similar to the layout they currently have, but has a few variations as well. I didn't let them look at the site so as not to draw on the ideas that were already in place.</p>

<p>Here is the layout that one of my friends did for the Foldable Me site. I didn't allow him to view the website before-hand, so it would be a more original creation.</p>

<p>My girlfriend made the final layout design for the wesite. There's a lot of variation in the designs from various people.</p>

<p>First, I sorted the cards, in a way that I thought was most intuitive for the user. This involved some influence from the existing website since I had already seen it. Next, I had my roommate, friend, and girlfriend, do some card sorts and organize the site the way they thought best.
</p>
<p>It turned out, I got a lot of different designs and possible insight for a new design for the website. I had never done the card sort activity before, but it turned out to be a very simple way to get other people's ideas and formulate the best website possible. I would likely do this activity again in the future for designing a website.
