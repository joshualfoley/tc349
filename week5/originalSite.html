<h1>Original Website</h1>
<body>
<p>In my website project this semester, I hope to build a great working template and learn all about how to make a webpage more desirable to the viewer, but also more functional. It's the first thing people notice, right off the bat if a webpage is faulty or poorly designed. Which is why it's extremely important to business owners, small and large to have a beautiful web page to display to customers and viewers. I just hope to have a good enough basic understanding of dreamweaver and web design to be able to do my own projects.</p>
<p>The first image is the most basic layout form my simple website that I've designed thus far.</p>
<p> <img src="Original1.JPG" height="300" width="300">
</p>
<p>The second image is a layout that my friend envisioned, he decided to add an image and horizontal links for the other pages.</p>
<p> <img src="Original2.JPG" height="300" width="300">
</p>
<p>The third layout, created by my roommate is similar with the image and horizontal layout, but he decided to put the picture at the top left with the twitter link also on top.</p>

<p>The last layout, designed by my girlfriend contains a vertical layout for the navigation to other pages, and the image in the center of the homepage.</p>

</p>
<p>Getting the insight and ideas from other people as to how to design the layout of a site and deciding which items in the site should be placed where specifically opens the door to newer and better web design layouts.
</p>
<p>It always helps to get other people's perspectives, and when you do, you realize that your ideas and ways of doing things are not always the best. Plus you can take bits and pieces from multiple design layouts, using card sorting to differentiate the various designs and help to bring you your final product. A well designed and laid out web page.
