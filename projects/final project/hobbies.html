              <p>Here are some activities that I enjoy participating in here on campus, as well as off campus.</p>
    
    <h3>Sports</h3>

    <p id="sportsPara">Sports have always been a large part of my life. I enjoy playing soccer and frisby. The past 3 years here at MSU, I've participated in the IM Sports, playing outdoor and indoor soccer. Last year we won the indoor league we were in, this past fall we got 2nd place in the outdoor league, and I'm currently playing indoor with the same group of guys. It's a lot of fun and it's great excercise, as well as an opportunity to build friendships with people I otherwise would not have met.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy playing frisby casually when it's warmer and not so windy outside. It's definitely more of a relaxing sport and something to enjoy without the competition that comes with playing soccer.</p>
    
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>My parents got me into music at a young age and I've been with it ever since. My mom got me and my sisters into violin lessons at the age of 6, and I played for a long time. Since I started college, I haven't had as much time to play, but when I get the chance, it's always fun to practice. I also, more recently have started to play the guitar. It's been easy to transfer what I've learned from the violin into guitar, so the learning curve has been more gradual.</p>
