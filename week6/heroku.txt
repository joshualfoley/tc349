\f0\fs24 \cf0 The site, www.heroku.com has a few noticeable problems with it. The color scheme is very detracting from the site. It's a boring purplish color, with a plain black background. I would have made a more interesting color scheme. When looking at a webpage you want one that is going to grab your attention so you don't move onto another website. Web developers can do this by using lots of bright and exciting colors, using pictures people can relate to, and not filling the site up with lots of words rather than just the simple ideas.  The links at the bottom of the page are very hard to see as well. Its hard to do a color like the dark purple then make the font a faint color. If I see a website with text like this, usually I just skip over it and move on to a new webpage because its too much work trying to read it when you can barely see it. \

Another thing I noticed is that the wording on the website is very computer centered so if you aren't that into the computer processing or know a lot about computers you wouldn't fully understand this website. Something that might scare users that don't know much about computers is the box on the right under the "See Everything" page. THere is a lot of programming wording such as, "compiled slug size", " $ heroku create", "Agile deployment for Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Java, Python, and Scala". All those words and phrases would be something someone would look at, not understand it,  and just move on. The website should use more simple terms when explaining the website and what it does. There are probably more people that don't know a lot about this computer stuff than those that do, so the majority of readers would have very little knowledge when reading this website.\

My Personal Website: I feel like this week's lessons have taught me a lot more about how to visually improve the look of a site, now I just have to practice. It's frustrating at times, but once you figure something out in html or css, it's all worth it. I chose to combine the look of the Double column layout, as well as the Gallery for my ROTC page, I think it turned out quite nice. I had already had a background image for that site so I didn't mess with it. The portfolio page, I floated the picture and the text and couldn't get it the way I liked at first, but I fiddled with it a bit and got it looking ok. The Hobbies one was a little more complex because I had 2 different categories, so I wanted them to look ok in the gallery style. It turned out looking a little rough, but I'm excited to practice more with it and make it look really good. For the homepage, I just floated the image and the navigation bar, and added an image from the subtle patterns site.\
