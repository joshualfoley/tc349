\f0 A webpage has to be easily accessible for the user. It has to be user friendly and be able to give you the information you are looking for right at your fingertips. Michigan State\'92s homepage is a very good webpage. It has information about the college, a page where you can donate money, as well as an athletic page to stay on top of your favorite Spartans schedule. Even some good webpages have their downfalls.\
	I think that the webpage has too many drop down options on the top of the page. They give main headings, but then have at least five different subheadings on the drop down option. Web users want there to be the information they are looking for right away, but having too many options may cause havoc and start to stress out the user. Too many options for people make them frustrated, some give up on using the webpage, and go to a different source for information. \
	As a student, I want the tools we need to be successful here at Michigan State accessible at all times. I think that the MSU webpage needs to have the most commonly used technological tool that students use, Angel. Students are always on Angel so having a link right on the main page, not a dropdown option but a specific button would be very useful. Any button that the student uses daily is something that should be on the main webpage, only hoping to make the students online tasks easier and a time saver.
