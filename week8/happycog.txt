\f0\fs24 \cf0 Happy Cog is a very well done web site, which is expected, as they specialize in web design and user experience. There are however, a few critiques I would like to make to their website. The opening page a lot of bright color, but when you click on the "Start your project with Happy Cog" it takes you to a very bland black and white page with minimal green accents. I think there should be some consistency in the color scheme.\
\
Another somewhat annoying feature that a lot of websites these days use is the navigation that simply automatically scrolls you down the page. when I click on a tab, I expect it to take me to a different page, not just scroll me down to a part of the page I've already seen.\
\
One final critique for the page is the social networking icons used at the bottom of the screen. I like how they didn't use the standard icons, but what they replaced the twitter and Facebook icons with is very pixely. While everything else on the website is very sharp, these icons class with the rest.}
