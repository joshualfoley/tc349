\f0\fs24 \cf0 There are a few problems with Etsy's site I see right off the bat. The margins on the sides seem too big. There is a lot of empty white space filling the screen. Also, the Etsy button at the top left of the screen is orange, which I don't feel goes with the color scheme very well. I picture a red button to better match the scheme. I also don't think the help button should be all the way in the right corner, the other links are on the left and it just seems over there alone.\
\
I also have a hard time figuring out how to interpret the site. There are "handpicked items" that are "picked?" by random people. I guess I just don't see the relevance there. The next "box" down on the page is featured shop. This seems like a more relevant portion to have up at the top, because it features different artists and their products.\

Also, the side bar with all of the categories could be improved. For each category, there should be either a preview image or a better hover over animation than a simple blue background.}
