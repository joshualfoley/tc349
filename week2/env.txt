\f0\fs24 \cf0 	I chose to use Adobe Dreamweaver for a few reasons. The text mate that's been shown in the tutorials looks like a good system, but without buying the program, I only get a 30 day trial, so I figured I would use what I have. I already bought the Adobe design suite so why not use it? I'm very excited to get to know how to better use dreamweaver. I've used it in the past, but have very very littler experience, so I have plenty of room to learn. It has a steep learning curve, but I feel like the options within the program allow it to be navigated relatively easily.\

	I like that Dreamweaver has the option to go between the code and the design views. This makes it possible for me to learn how to do something with code by simply doing it with the design and then learning how to write the code, because I know it's very important to be able to do the coding and not just let dreamweaver do it for you. There's also the hybrid view which is interesting and helpful at times. Another great feature is the "test" button which allows me to see what it will look like in the browser without actually opening the browser and refreshing it. I'm excited to learn what kinds of things I can do with dreamweaver and the many advantages there are that come along with learning to develop websites.}
