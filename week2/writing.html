<h2>Panic.com Critique
</h2>
<p>
The main problem I see with this site is their use of colors and symbols. They use baby blue, yellow, and red which kind of makes their page look like a children's room. I also think they could have come up with a better slogan than "Hi. We're Panic. We make super nice apps for Macs, iPhones, and iPads:" It just seems like that's the first thing that popped into their head so they used it.
</p>
<p>
A somewhat obvious flaw to their site is their attempt to sell t-shirts and apparel. They need to stay on topic and focus on the apps they create. Also, on the introduction page, they should have some more useful information about each app so you don't have to click on each one and navigate to a new page to see what it is. They have a quick mouse-over popup that briefly tells you what it is, but I think there could be more.
</p>
<p>
Near the bottom of the page there is a help bar. However, they used a very dark grey background and have a line that says "Need help from us? We're here." but it's written in black, so it's very hard to see if your screen brightness is turned down. Additionally, their use of phrases like "Better at Everything" or "One-more-thing thing" makes them seem unprofessional.
